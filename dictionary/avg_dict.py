##  Implement a calculateAvg function that receives the ages dictionary as a â€‹parameter,
# and returns the average age of the students.

def calculateAvg(ages):

  average = sum(ages.values())/length   # sum/length
   #print (length)
  return average  # sum(dictionary.values()) function to calculate the sum of values in a dictionary.
